value of order of binomial n.sp[2,1,1] must be greater than zero -> Fixed by providing N_inits (2 x n + 2)
value of bernoulli z[1,1] must be an integer -> moved z = matrix(1, nrow=90, ncol=length(periods)) to data from inits (2023-09-11 This is incorrect because z is not observable.)
value of order of binomial n.sp[1,1,1] must be greater than zero (see https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/22850/winbugs-error-with-zero-values-in-binomial-distribution-value-of-order-of-binom) 
-> All to do with N_inits. 
value of binomial n.sp[116,2,3] must be between zero and order of n.sp[116,2,3]
-> N_inits values have to be greater than either values in n[j,1,t] or n[j,2,t]. I added the following lines to fix this problem. 

N_inits1 <- n[, 1,] * 2 + 2
N_inits2 <- n[, 2,] * 2 + 2 
            
N_inits <- N_inits1
N_inits[N_inits1 < N_inits2] <- N_inits2[N_inits1 < N_inits2]

N_inits <- rbind(N_inits,
                 matrix(data = NA, nrow = 2, ncol = length(periods)))

N_inits needs to be NAs for where there was no data. So, lines above, N_inits1 and N_inits2 need to be modified so that NAs have to be inserted where there is no data. For example...

n <- BUGS.data$n
for (k in 1:ncol(n)){
  if (BUGS.data$periods[k] < nrow(n))
    n[(BUGS.data$periods[k]+1):nrow(n),k] <- NA
} 

N_inits1 <- n * 2 + 2

value of bernoulli z[1,1] must be an integer -> the dimensions of beta.sp, sd.b.sp, and z in jags.inits function need to be changed. I now use "x" to define the number of years to be analyzed. x is shared within the function so no need to change them individually. 2022-04-06

The same problem came back when analyzing Laake's data. The fix above did not solve the problem. 2023-09-11
This problem goes away when N, N.com, and N.sp are removed from the inits function. However, the other problem pops up: "value of order of binomial n.sp[1,1,1] must be greater than zero." This problem was solved by providing N_inits before...

  # It turned out a new observer (JSD) was introduced when a shorter minimum was used to filter
  # observation period. "JSD" was only found in 2020 (200109_080043). A strange thing happened for that day.
  # During the 0800 shift, JSD/JWG changed to SJC/JDS on 0900, then the shift continued until 0930. The new
  # cutoff time (30 min) picked up the first (1 hr) and the second (30 min) as separate observation periods.
