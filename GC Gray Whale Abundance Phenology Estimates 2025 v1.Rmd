## Introduction {.unnumbered}

The Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) regularly conducts shore-based surveys of eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whales (*Eschrichtius robustus*) to estimate abundance. These estimates are obtained from visual survey data collected off central California between December and February during the gray whale southward migration, and provide regular updates to a time series of abundance estimates that began in 1967 (@laake2012). Surveys have recorded an increasing trend in ENP gray whale abundance until the 2015/2016 season. Since then, however, estimated abundances indicated a decline from 2015/2016 of 26,960 whales (95% CI = 24,420-29,830) to 14,526 whales (95% CI = 13,194 - 16,040) in 2022/2023 (Eguchi et al. 2023a). Even though these estimates were greater than the estimate from 1967 (13,426 whales, CV = 0.094, Laake et al. 2012), the observed decline in the consecutive surveys raised a concern about the status of the population. The data from the 2023/2024 season indicated an increase in abundance (Eguchi et al. 2024). The estimated rate of increase over the two years, however, was biologically unplausible, indicating other factors must be playing a role in the observed increase. This report presents a new estimate of abundance for ENP gray whales migrating southward off the central California coast between December 2024 and February 2025.

## Methods {.unnumbered}

Data for this updated abundance estimate were collected during the `r YEAR-1`-`r YEAR` southward ENP gray whale migration between `r min(as.Date(data.first.$V3, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% format("%d %B %Y")` and `r max(as.Date(data.last.$V3, format = "%m/%d/%Y")) %>% format("%d %B %Y")`. Counts were made from a shore-based watch station at Granite Canyon, California, by observer pairs rotating from a larger pool. Each survey day was split into six 90-minute shifts. As was the case for the previous analyses since 2006, only shifts with at least 85 minutes of survey effort were included in the analysis. Some shifts were less than 85 minutes due to inclement weather and less-than-ideal sighting conditions (e.g., Beaufort sea state greater than 4). Sampling and analytical methods are described in a previous publication (@durban2015a.

The estimated abundance reported here was computed using the N-mixture modeling approach used previously by SWFSC for surveys conducted between the 2006/2007 and `r seasons[length(seasons)-1]` seasons (Durban et al. 2015, 2017, Stewart and Weller 2021a, Eguchi et al. 2022a, 2023a, 2024). In this approach, the sighting probability of shore-based observers was estimated by using data from replicate surveys (i.e., data collected simultaneously by two independent observer teams) that were completed in the  2009/2010 and 2010/2011 seasons and covariates that affect sighting probabilities (i.e., visibility, sea state, and observers). These sighting probability estimates allowed the total number of whales passing through the survey area during a watch period to be estimated from the observed number of whales, even in years when replicate surveys were not conducted.

In the analysis, the start date of the southward migration for the Granite Canyon study site is fixed at 1 December and the end date at 28 February, where the number of whales passing the watch station on those two dates is assumed zero. The daily count data are assumed to be random deviates from binomial distributions with the estimated sighting probability and the true but unknown number of whales in the sampling area, which is assumed to change as a function of the number of days since 1 December. The model fits two possible functions to the daily counts of whales and select a function that fits better for each count. These functions are (i) a normal distribution with the peak in the daily number of whales passing occurs at the midpoint of the migration and (ii) a spline fit that allows the change in the daily number of whales to flexibly match the observed daily counts without expectations about the shape of the curve. The model then internally selects which of these two candidate functions best matches the daily number of observed whales. The final abundance estimate is the sum of the estimated number of whales passing the survey area each day, with a correction factor applied to account for those that migrate through the study area at night (Perryman et al. 1999). The modeling approach is described in detail in Durban et al. (2015; 2017).

Because the N-mixture modeling approach uses all data since the 2006/2007 season to estimate parameters that are shared among yearly datasets, estimated abundances change as more data are added to the analysis. Before the 2024 report (Eguchi et al. 2024), only the new estimate was provided while keeping the estimates for previous years as they were provided in the reports. In the 2024 report, we provided both old and new estimates. In this report, we provide only updated estimates for all years since the 2006/2007 season. For old estimates, please see Eguchi et al. (2024). 

Similarly to the recent reports (Eguchi et al. 2022a, 2023a, 2024), we examined the annual median migration date, which was defined previously [@rugh_timing_2001] as "the date when 50% of the whale sightings had been recorded at a research site or (if data were not available for calculating the median) the date corresponding with the apex of a unimodal sighting curve." Following the first definition, median migration dates are determined using sightings rather than estimated abundances. The latter definition, however, is applicable for estimated numbers, if the model has a unimodal distribution. In our approach, the model selected a better function between the normal and spline fits for each day. Consequently, the results are not unimodal for some years (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-daily-fit)). We, therefore, use the date when 50% of the whale sightings had been recorded as the median migration date.

In order to examine possible changes in the median migration dates over time, segmented linear models were fitted to the relationship between median migration dates and year using the *segmented* package (v. `r packageVersion("segmented")`, @muggeo_interval_2017). All statistical analyses were conducted within the R statistical environment (v. `r paste0(R.Version()$major, ".", R.Version()$minor)`, R Core Team `r R.Version()$year`).

### Abundance estimates {.unnumbered}

From `r format(as.Date(paste0(YEAR - 1, "-11-30")) + data.new$Data_Out[1, "BeginDay"], "%d %B %Y")` to `r format(as.Date(paste0(YEAR - 1, "-11-30")) + data.new$Data_Out[nrow(data.new$Data_Out), "BeginDay"], "%d %B %Y")`, `r length(unique(data.new$Data_Out$obs))` trained observers completed `r signif(whale.groups.daily.new[nrow(whale.groups.daily.new), "cumu.Effort"], 4)` hours of survey effort over `r nrow(whale.groups.daily.new)` survey days. A total of `r sum(whale.groups.daily.new$n.Groups)` groups of `r whale.groups.daily.new[nrow(whale.groups.daily.new), "cumu.N"]` whales were counted. The highest daily count was `r max(daily.counts$n.day)` whales on `r daily.counts %>% filter(n.day == max(n.day)) %>% dplyr::select("Date") %>% as.data.frame() %>% format("%d %B %Y")` (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-daily-fit)). Due to the inclement weather and other constraints (e.g., poor visibility due to fog and rain), some observation periods were \< 85 min in duration and were excluded from analysis. Furthermore, groups that were moving north were excluded from the analysis. After removing these survey hours and groups, `r signif(sum(data.new$Complete_Data$dur) * 24, 4)` hours of survey effort with `r sum(daily.n.df[,ncol(daily.n.df)])` whales in `r sum(daily.counts$n.group)` groups was retained for further analyses. Estimated total abundance of ENP gray whales during the `r paste0(YEAR-1, "/", YEAR)` southbound migration season was `r estimate.new$Nhat %>% format.big.number()` (95% Credible Interval: `r estimate.new$LCL %>% format.big.number()` - `r estimate.new$UCL %>% format.big.number()`, CV = `r signif(CV.Nhat.new, 3)`, 20-percentile = `r quantile(WinBUGS.results$BUGS.out$sims.list$Corrected.Est[,x], 0.2) %>% format.big.number()`). This estimate includes the multiplicative correction factor for nighttime passage (mean = 1.0875, SD = 0.03625, Perryman et al. 1999). This estimate represents a `r abs(signif((estimate.new$Nhat - estimate.last.year$Nhat)/estimate.last.year$Nhat, 3)) * 100`% decrease from the previous estimate for the `r seasons[(length(seasons)-1)]` season (`r estimate.last.year$Nhat %>% format.big.number()`; Table \@ref(tab:Table-Nhats-v1)). After an observed increase between the 2022/2023 and 2023/2024 seasons, this was a disappointing finding (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-nhats-v1)). This is the second lowest estimate since the survey started in 1967.

Using the long time series of estimated abundance of ENP gray whales from Granite Canyon, CA, a recent integrated population modeling analysis indicated that fluctuations in the gray whale abundance was likely associated with availability of benthic prey in the Arctic region ([@stewart_boom-bust_2023]). The time series suggests that observed fluctuations are common. The observed declines in abundance might represent short-term events that had not resulted in any detectable longer-term impacts on the population. That is, despite occasional declines in abundance since the time-series of data began in 1967, the population continues to fluctuate (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-nhats-v1)). Given the rapid changes in ocean environment, especially in the Arctic region where gray whales forage, continuous monitoring is essential to determine the degree of fluctuations in the future. NOAA/NMFS plan to closely monitor the population with regular surveys to estimate abundance, calf production and body condition of gray whales. The results of these research efforts will continue to provide the best scientific information available regarding the status of the population.

As it was reported in previous reports (Eguchi et al. 2022a, 2023a, 2024), timing of migration, measured by the median migration date, changed significantly over the survey period (Figure \@ref(fig:Figure-phenology)). From the beginning of the survey (1967) through the 1970s, they were generally earlier than 10 January (Day 40). They linearly increased over the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s. Since the mid 2000s, there was a linear decline. An analysis using a linear segmented regression indicated that change points in slopes occurred at years `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[1,2], 5)` (SE = `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[1,3], 3)`) and `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[2,2], 5)` (SE = `r signif(lm.1.seg.1$psi[2,3], 3)`). As expected, these estimated change points were statistically not different from the estimates from last year (1976.5 $\pm$ 3.89, 2008 $\pm$ 3.37). The estimated slopes for the three segments were `r signif(slopes$Year[1,1], 3)` (SE = `r signif(slopes$Year[1,2], 3)`), `r signif(slopes$Year[2,1], 3)` (SE = `r signif(slopes$Year[2,2], 3)`), and `r signif(slopes$Year[3,1], 3)` (SE = `r signif(slopes$Year[3,2], 3)`), respectively. Estimated slopes also were not different from the previous report (-0.104 $\pm$ 0.355, 0.476 $\pm$ 0.0885, -0.273 $\pm$ 0.162, Eguchi et al. 2024). The median migration date for the `r seasons[length(seasons)]` season was `r median.idx.df[nrow(median.idx.df), "median.idx"]`, which was `r abs(median.idx.df[nrow(median.idx.df), "median.idx"] - median.idx.df[nrow(median.idx.df)-1, "median.idx"])` days earlier than the previous season. Biological and ecological significance of these changes is unknown. Studies on body conditions, environmental fluctuations, migration paths, shifts in diet, and health status may provide information on possible mechanisms of changes in the migration timing of gray whales.
